In general ELENA supports two types of output : standalone and a VM client. A client can be generated by the compiler. But it is possible
to work with the virtual machine directly. In this tutorial I will show how it is possible to invoke ELENA code from another application.
In our examples we will use two languages : C++ and C#. 

Let's start with a simple ELENA code. We will declare a function which will print its argument adding a literal string:

    public printingOut(arg)
    {
       console.writeLine(arg + " from ELENA VM");
    }

Because our code is not going to be used standalone, we have to create a library - embedded1.prj and compile it:
